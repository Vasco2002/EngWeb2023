                    <p>Analysis of the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus genome indicates that the bacterium may have originated on the surface of a plant.
                    Milk may have become spontaneously and unintentionally exposed to it through contact with plants,
                    or bacteria may have been transferred from the udder of domestic milk-producing animals.
                    The origins of yogurt are unknown, but it was probably invented by Neolithic people in Central Asia and Mesopotamia around 5000 BC,
                    when the first milk-producing animals were domesticated. They most likely found out how to ferment milk by chance and in all likelihood, 
                    yogurt was discovered independently in this way in many different places at different times.</p>

                    <p>The cuisine of ancient Greece included a dairy product known as oxygala which was a form of yogurt. 
                        Galen mentioned that oxygala was consumed with honey, similar to the way thickened Greek yogurt is eaten today. 
                        The oldest writings mentioning yogurt are attributed to Pliny the Elder, 
                        who remarked that certain "barbarous nations" knew how "to thicken the milk into a substance with an agreeable acidity". 
                        The use of yogurt by medieval Turks is recorded in the books Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk by Mahmud Kashgari 
                        and Kutadgu Bilig by Yusuf Has Hajib written in the 11th century. Both texts mention the word "yogurt" 
                        in different sections and describe its use by nomadic Turks. The earliest yogurts were probably spontaneously 
                        fermented by wild bacteria in goat skin bags.</p>

                    <p>Although yogurt is generally assumed to be a nutritious snack, you would be wise to look beyond the packaging and perceptions to uncover 
                        the facts. Many of the drinkable, spoonable and squeezable yogurt products that come in countless flavors and packages are not all they 
                        appear to be. Most are loaded with added sugar, artificial ingredients and fillers. The majority contain only a marginal amount of 
                        probiotics. Sadly, the yogurt you are consuming from your local grocery store may not be benefiting your health as much as you think.</p>
                    <p>Making yogurt at home is not only healthier and more nutritious, it also saves you from unhealthy additives and sugars in the store 
                        bought yogurt. Homemade yogurt- when made right- turns out thick, creamy, and naturally flavorful, so you don't need artificial 
                        thickeners, sweeteners, or other additives.</p>
                    <p>Also, making your own yogurt is way cheaper than buying yogurt at the store. 
                        Depending on the milk you buy and the kind of yogurt you like, homemade yogurt costs 60 to 80 percent less. 
                        It's easy to calculate the savings, because one litre of milk makes a 750-g tub of yogurt (plus some).</p>
